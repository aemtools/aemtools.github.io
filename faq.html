<h3>AEM Tools FAQ</h3>

<dl>
    <dt>
        Plugin suggests Sling Model for completion in
        <code>data-sly-use</code> but in runtime I have error <i>org.apache.sling.scripting.sightly.render.AbstractRuntimeObjectModel Cannot access
        method &lt;my method name&gt;</i>, what am I doing wrong?
    </dt>
    <dd>Please make sure that you have correct OSGi directive `Sling-Models-Package` present in sling models containing module. The AEM Tools plugin
        doesn't take into consideration neither it's presence or correctness.

        I open HTL file but it seems that it is not recognized by plugin, how do I fix that?
    </dt>
    <dd>
        By default <strong>only</strong> html files under
        <strong>jcr_root</strong> folder are considered as HTL files.
        You can mark any additional directory as "HTL Root" via context menu
        <code>Mark directory as -> HTL Root</code>

        There are several different plugins with AEM support available for Intellij IDEA,
        what the difference comparing to {{ site.data.common.pluginName }}?
        Won't it conflict with them?
